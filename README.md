# exercise-app

This is a React Native application that displays a list of exercises and allows the user to select an exercise to perform. If the exercise is a "reps" type, the user will be taken to a "Reps" screen where they can perform the exercise by inputting the number of reps they completed. If the exercise is a "timer" type, the user will be taken to a "Timer" screen where they can start a timer for the exercise. 

The notes modal, (which is rendered with each exercise in the list), provides a way for users to add comments or notes to an exercise. This allows users to track their progress or remember important details about an exercise, such as the number of reps they completed or the amount of weight lifted. Additionally, it also allows users to personalize their workout by adding their own comments or reminders. The modal also includes an editing feature, which allows users to update their notes as needed. 

Finally, there is a create exercise component that allows users to create any exercise that they want that isn’t included in the current list of exercises and set it to a “reps” or “timer” exercise accordingly.
